Forage DNA barcoding: data analysis workflow

This set of scripts were used to analyze DNA barcoding data from forage plants. They involve the following steps:
1. Re-formatting the headers of BOLD sequences
2. Blasting queries vs reference sequences
3. Match calling with a "Leave-One-Out" approach

## Step 1: Re-formatting the headers of BOLD sequences
Poaceae and Fabaceae sequences for barcodes <i>matK</i>, <i>rbcLa</i>, and <i>trnH-psbA</i> were downloaded from BOLD v4.



## Step 2: Blasting queries vs reference sequences
## Step 3: Match calling
